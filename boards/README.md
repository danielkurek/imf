# Boards

Boards were designed in KiCAD 7 (then converted to KiCAD 8). In folders `esp32-s3-main` and `esp32-s3-simple` are source files for boards along with exported schematics to PDF, exported BOM and gerbers ready for manufacturing.

`esp32-s3-main` contains board that is used in this work as main module and `esp32-s3-simple` is used as secondary module.
