# BLE mesh TODO
 - [x] basic example
 - [x] identify devices when provisioning
 - [ ] easier provisioning interface (some app or _automatic provisioning_)
   - app
     - [android lib](https://github.com/NordicSemiconductor/Android-nRF-Mesh-Library)
     - [ios lib](https://github.com/NordicSemiconductor/IOS-nRF-Mesh-Library) (probably not ios since i cannot test it)
 - [ ] separate ble and other logic
 - [ ] add OTA
   - WiFi or BLE???
     - wifi will make the app larger (buy larger flash size modules)
 - [ ] on the fly configuration of station/mobile
   - maybe it does not make sense since station device will most likely be different
     - larger battery
     - larger display??
     - brighter/more LEDs
 - [x] sensor example - not suitable for my use case
 - [x] location server/client example
 - [ ] external FTM sensor
 - [ ] throughput test
 - [ ] add proxy to all nodes
 - [ ] make app to see status of all nodes and control them
   - maybe nrf Mesh app can do it
