# TODO list
 - [ ] BLE mesh
   - [ ] simple example
   - [ ] try centralized logging
 - [ ] WIFI configuration
   - [ ] each device can have its own AP
   - [ ] switch to configuration mode by holding button at boot
   - [ ] dump log
   - [ ] NVS configuration
   - [ ] centralized configuration
     - [ ] discover other devices
     - [ ] external WIFI network (devices will not have its own AP)
       - [ ] multiple options
         - [ ] detect if there is external network (by SSID); otherwise create own
         - [ ] special key combination to enter this mode
     - [ ] web interface
     - [ ] synchronize logs?
 - [ ] logging
   - [x] test UART log
   - [ ] more space efficient
     - [ ] simple compression?? (probably not)
     - [ ] shorter tags
     - [ ] simpler messages
   - [x] detect full capacity
     - [x] overwrite log from beginning?
   - [ ] better dumping (to file on PC)
     - maybe only through WIFI interface??
     - could be useful to transfer it through serial
   - [ ] C++ support
     - [ ] namespace LOG + simple function names
 - [ ] OTA updates
   - [ ] simple test
   - [ ] through centralized configuration?
     - [ ] select which devices should get which firmware
